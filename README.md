# To-Do List App Using React
### This web app allows users to add Todos. Users can add projects/categories to add the todo to. I believe tasks need to be seen in a non-hectic way which is why I have given the web app an aesthetic touch. 

## Challenges
- User authentication is not implemented yet. We can implement logins so users can view and add tasks specific to them. We would need to implement authentication with firebase and every user will need to have a default project and todos collection in the database when signing up.
- Mobile View can be implemented to make it more accessible.

## Future scopes
- We could add a pomodoro tab to help users focus and help them complete their tasks
- A tab lock could be implemented (or full screen mode) preventing users from distraction.
